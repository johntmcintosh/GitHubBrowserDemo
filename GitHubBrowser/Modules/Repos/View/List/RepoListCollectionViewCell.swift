// NOTE: For a production app, I'd likely implement the content view of the UICollectionViewCell as it's own view and
// then add it as a subview so there was more flexibility in case it also needed to be displayed in other contexts.
// However, for simplicity in this demo app, I'm implementing it directly in the UICollectionViewCell subclass.
